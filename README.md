**Behemut** stood bleeding from a wound in his side, somehow that damned orc had
managed to slip a dagger between his scales and pierce him deeply. The Drake
continent lay in ruins, the Orcs and Humans somehow managing to put aside their
hatred and unify into a solid force, marching on the Drakes with footfalls that
sounded like thunder - like the very heavens tearing themselves apart.  
  
**Behemut** watched as his people, his glorious Drakes, fought with everything they
had, decimating ranks of Orcs, Trolls, Ogres, Humans, Dwarves... but it wasn't 
enough. The combined forces had reached the great rookery and destroyed all of
the eggs. None were left. Only the Drakes on this battlefield stood to continue
their legacy. But it seemed as if none would survive, as the alliance of the
Humans and Orcs surrounded the last of the Drakes. **The Champion of Bahgtru** stood
in front of **Behemut**, taunting him.  '*It's all over now drakey! You'se gonna see
alla yer scaley pals die right here an' now. And then yer gonna bleed out. How's
it feel to know ya lost, ya scaley mutt?*'  
  
**Behemut** looked up at the orc then, and chuckled.  '*Lost? If all is lost... then I
am going to take as many with me as I can.*' he said, before letting out his bugling
call one final time, as he released the ***Pattern Reave*** in a blast stronger than any
the world had seen. A wave of blinding energy rippled through the combined enemy
forces, killing most where they stood - but those were the lucky ones, as reality
shivered and bent, turning some inside-out, others were reduced to liquid or a
fine red mist, some where swallowed up as the ground beneath their feet became a
gaping maw... the ***Reave*** had never been fully unleashed, not like this. Not even
the mended could withstand the threads of the tapestry of creation being violently
ripped out. When it was over, **Behemut** smiled. His breath was labored now, coming
in great gulps, but he steadied himself enough to look at the orc - or what was 
left of it, anyway - and said '*It is done...*' as he collapsed to the ground.  
  
Where the forces had battled was now a smoking crater, the Drakes had lost, but
**Behemut** took the majority of the enemy forces with him. He breathed his last, 
knowing that the Humans and Orcs had paid for what they had done, and paid dearly.
