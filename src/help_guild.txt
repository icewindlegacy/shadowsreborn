requirements for joining.

CGUILD

- To outcast someone from your clan: cguild <character> 
  (When used on a current clan member, they become outcast)

  (Only immortals can remove outcast status)

Note: Only clan leaders can use this command. You must be a leader of a 
clan to invite or outcast members.
